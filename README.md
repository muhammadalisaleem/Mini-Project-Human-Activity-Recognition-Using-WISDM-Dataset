# Mini-Project-Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-WISDM-Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of accelerometer data collected from users performing different physical activities. It includes six columns: User_ID, Activity_Label, Timestamp, and three accelerometer readings (X, Y, Z).  The goal was to classify these activities using various machine learning models.
